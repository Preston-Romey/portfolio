        <h3>Wanted to tell you about a type of pencil by Faber that I've found. Here you see the thickness of the cross section. 
        They're soft and better quality than the carpenter's pencils, produce a marvellous black and are very agreeable to 
        work with for large studies.</h3>
        
        <h3>- Vincent Van Gogh, 1883</h3>

<p>Faber-Castell is one of the oldest and highest quality colored pencil brands in the world. Master artists swear by their 
durability, and their prices are mitigated by smaller and cheaper beginner packages.
Faber-Castell puts work into their physical displays in other stores, even sending their own representatives to art stores across America 
to make sure the quality of their pencils is seen at evey touchpoint. However, online shoppers are growing, and Faber-Castell does not have an
digital presence that reflects the quality of their product. We framed this problem with the question:
</p>

<h3>How might we deliver Faber-Castell's quality in store service on a digital medium?</h3>

<p>Our solution was a mobile-first website that showed the pencils off how a sales representative would,
and that reflected the experience and visuals one would see at a faber castell display in an art store, 
so the experiences wouldn't alienatelongtime fans of Faber-Castell, and to preserve some of the tradition 
of the venerable company. 

I spent a lot of time working on the concept video. I don't think it communicates the project as well as the scenario video. 
It was shown before our presentation and gets at the aspirational values of the audience we were designing for, but looking
back I think it should have focused more on introducing some of the business problems facing Faber-Castell, like their lack
 of online presence, and the intimidation a new artist might face at an art store when confronted with a wall of expensive colors</p>
