        <h3>I wanted to tell you about a type of pencil by Faber that I've found. Here you see the thickness of the cross section. 
        They're soft and better quality than the carpenter's pencils, produce a marvellous black and are very agreeable to 
        work with for large studies.</h3>
        
        <h3>- Vincent Van Gogh, 1883</h3>

<p>
    Faber-Castell is one of the oldest and highest quality colored pencil brands in the world. Master artists swear by their 
    durability, while their luxury prices are mitigated by smaller and cheaper beginner packages.
    Faber-Castell runs their own shops in the UK, while overseas they put work into their physical displays in other stores, even sending their own representatives to art stores across America 
    to run art shows and engage artists with expert information and tools. Faber-Castell makes sure the quality of their pencils is seen at evey touchpoint. However, the online shopping market is growing, and Faber-Castell does not have a
    digital presence that reflects the quality of their product. We framed this problem with the question:
</p>

<h3>How might we deliver Faber-Castell's quality in-store service on a digital medium?</h3>

<p>Our solution was a mobile-first website that showed the pencils off in the same way a sales representative would,
a one to one reflection of the experience one would have in an art store. Our goal was to ensure the new experience wouldn't alienate
longtime fans of Faber-Castell, and to preserve some of the tradition of the venerable company.</p>
